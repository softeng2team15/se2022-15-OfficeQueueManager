TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 15)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
- Total points committed vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| AS A **CUSTOMER** I WANT TO GET A TICKET SO THAT I ENTER MY SERVICE QUEUE | 3 | 5 | 6 | 15 |
| AS AN **OFFICER** I WANT TO GET THE NEXT CUSTOMER SO THAT I CAN SERVE HIM/HER | 3 | 3 | 4.5 | 3 |
| AS A **CUSTOMER** I WANT TO KNOW THE LENGTH OF MY SERVICE QUEUE | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3.5 |
| AS A **CUSTOMER** I WANT TO KNOW MY WAITING TIME | 3 | 5 | 4 | 11.5 |
| AS AN **OFFICER** I WANT TO KNOW THE SERVICES I CAN OFFER | 3 | 1 | 2.5 | 1.5 |


> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

  - standard deviation estimated 46 minutes, actual 2 hours and 15 minutes
  - average estimated 1 hour and 20 minutes per task, actual 2 hours per task

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent

  - 0,57
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 3 hours
  - Total hours spent 2 hours and 30 minutes
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 0
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 5 hours
  - Total hours spent 5 hour and 30 minutes
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 1 hour
  - Total hours spent 2 hours
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? Positivity and inexperience, and also the division of stories into tasks
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? We have to divide stories with a different and better approach, and make a standard template to agree between the frontend and backend parts of stories.
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? We didn't have any previous retrospective
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? We didn't have any previous retrospective
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) Be better with the communication between frontend and backend, especially on APIs schemes, and develop a better way to test

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!! How we managed to mesh well in such a short time
